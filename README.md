# Highway Life Saver

## 🚀 Inspiration
Highway accidents often result in delays in emergency response, costing valuable lives. We wanted to create a system that ensures faster medical assistance by integrating real-time detection and alerts.

## 💡 Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/highway-life-saver.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd highway-life-saver
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # For FastAPI backend
   npm install  # For React frontend
   ```
3. Run the backend:
   ```sh
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
4. Run the frontend:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
## ⚡ What it does
- Detects highway collisions autonomously.
- Monitors patient health in ambulances.
- Sends real-time alerts to nearby hospitals.
- Displays live patient health details on a dashboard.
- Includes phone and message-based alert systems.

## 🛠️ How we built it
